<h1>Finding scancodes?</h1>

<p>
 Scancodes are the lowest level identifiers of the keypress event.
 There is a standard table that convert standard scancodes to keycodes that
 can be processed by the console or X.
 If the laptop vendor uses scancodes that are not in this conversion table then
 the key does not get mapped and the following appears in dmesg:
</p>

<pre>
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x97 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e017 keycode' to make it known.
</pre>

<p>
 This means the scancode e017 could not be found in the standard table and the
 input event will not be mapped to any key.
 This means that the input <b>cannot</b> be remapped with a keymap as userspace
 is completely unaware of the input.
</p>

<p>
 You only need to remap keys using HAL that do not product valid keycodes
 (i.e. you get the warning in dmesg) as the others can be done with a keymap.
 Please <a href="quirk-keymap-try.html"> report and send patches to fix this.
